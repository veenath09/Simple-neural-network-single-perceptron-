This  is useful to  understand how neural networks works in the fundamental level.The codes here in this repository only use numpy, pandas, matplotlib and implements a simple neaural networks with one and two pecertron in low level using mathematical formulas . This repository is useful to understand a neural networks internal workings at a fundamental level.
